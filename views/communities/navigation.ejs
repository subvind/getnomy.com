        Within nomy communities are organizations of people where each person is assigned to a group(s) which grant or deny them permissions thoughout the app. Fuctionality is split into micro software as a service modules or ÂµSaaS Modules while data is split into tenant silos; this makes a lot of complex things like billing and backups simple. After a community is created and after a tenant silo is created get ready to take your community to the next level.
